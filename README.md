Enlightenment-Themes
====================

Various Enlightenment themes im working on, a branch per theme, development status for each theme is listed below

Building a theme is as simple as running the `./build-darkmod.sh` script. The built theme should be automatically put in your theme directory.

If you would like to modify one of the themes or create a new theme with vtx or darkmod take a look at [Hacking.md](Hacking.md)
